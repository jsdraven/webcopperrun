					  <p>The Copper Run 2014 lives on…because of You</p>
					  <br />
					  <br />
					  <p align="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty two years have passed since the Ed Friel Memorial Copper Run was founded. Since 
					  
					  1992, the generous support and participation of the Copper Run has accomplished so 
					  
					  much. We have been able to help preserve added safety for the entire Copperopolis Community 
					  
					  from the Volunteer Fire Department; and provide educational and sports programs to elementary 
					  
					  school children that would not be possible without donations from local businesses.					  </p>
					  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
					  <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These funds will be used to help cover the costs of our educational programs and on-going sports 
					  
					  projects at the school and provide continued support for the Volunteer Firefighter’s Association, as 
					  
					  well as provide assistance to the Copperopolis library. As much as we’ve accomplished, there is 
					  
					  still more work to be done.					  </p>
					  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
					  <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you can contribute as a runner or a sponsor, we thank you for your support!
					  
					  Your donation is a gift for the future ... for our children and grandchildren…and a more secure 
					  
					  future for all the citizens of Copperopolis.					  </p>
					  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
					  <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come for the race and stay for the weekend and enjoy the Sierra Foothills. </p>
